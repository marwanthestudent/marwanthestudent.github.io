Currently finishing up my bachelor's from [the University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu).


## Research

I'm currently involved in projects at the intersection of **signal processing**, **embedded systems**, and **HCI** at the [Hybrid Atelier](https://hybridatelier.uta.edu).

I focus on designing responsive hardware prototypes, developing signal-based interaction systems and user-centered embedded solutions.

## Teaching

I’ve served as a GTA and mentor for the following classes:
