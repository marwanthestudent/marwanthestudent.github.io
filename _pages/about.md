Currently finishing up my bachelor's from [the University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu) in<br>Computer Engineering!

## Research

I'm currently involved in projects at the intersection of **signal processing**, **embedded systems**, and **HCI** at the [Hybrid Atelier](https://hybridatelier.uta.edu).

I focus on designing responsive hardware prototypes, developing signal-based interaction systems and user-centered embedded solutions.

## Teaching

I’ve served as a GTA and mentor for the following classes:

[**Electronics CSE 3323**](https://catalog.uta.edu/search/?P=CSE%203323) — UTA, Spring 2025<br>
[**Intermediate Programming CSE 1320**](https://catalog.uta.edu/search/?P=CSE%201320) — UTA, Spring 2024<br>
[**Intermediate Programming CSE 1320**](https://catalog.uta.edu/search/?P=CSE%201320) — UTA, Fall 2023<br>
[**Introduction to Programming CSE 1320**](https://catalog.uta.edu/search/?P=CSE%201310) — UTA, Spring 2023<br>

## Publications

Coming Soon!

## Projects

Here are a few technical and personal projects I’ve worked on:

[**DigitalRF_station**](https://github.com/marwanthestudent/DigitalRF_Station)
  A massive wireless communications project that involved building circuits, embedded programming, designing and printing antennae, Signal processing and much more.
[**Image_Processing_Tool**](https://github.com/marwanthestudent/Image_processing_tool)
  An image processing application that does, gaussian blur, sharpening, unsharpening and edge detection on an image.
[**CustomAlloc**](https://github.com/marwanthestudent/CustomAlloc)
  An implementation of malloc, calloc, realloc and free in C.
[**Handpose_Estimation**](https://github.com/marwanthestudent/Handpose_Estimation)
  A 3D hand pose recognition system using a dataset of hand joint coordinates.
