Currently finishing up my bachelor's from [The University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu) in<br>Computer Engineering!

## Research

I'm currently involved in projects at the intersection of **signal processing**, **embedded systems**, and **HCI** at the [Hybrid Atelier](https://hybridatelier.uta.edu).

I focus on designing responsive hardware prototypes, developing signal-based interaction systems and user-centered embedded solutions.

## Teaching

I’ve served as a GTA and mentor for the following classes:

[Electronics CSE 3323](https://catalog.uta.edu/search/?P=CSE%203323) — UTA, Spring 2025<br>
